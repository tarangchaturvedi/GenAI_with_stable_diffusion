# Virtual Try-On Model using ViTOn-HD

This project implements a virtual try-on system using the ViTOn-HD (Vision Transformer for High Definition) model. The model has been fine-tuned to enhance the clothing fit, texture mapping, and overall image quality, enabling accurate and realistic virtual try-on experiences. Custom images are used for personalized clothing visualization, allowing users to try on clothes with enhanced image clarity and styling.

## Features
- **High-Quality Virtual Try-On:** Leverages the ViTOn-HD model for realistic clothing try-ons.
- **Custom Image Support:** Fine-tuned model to incorporate custom images for personalized try-on experiences.
- **Local Implementation:** Full local setup to process user inputs and generate virtual try-ons.
- **Improved Styling and Fit:** Enhanced clothing fit and texture mapping for a more lifelike experience.
- **Efficient Processing:** Optimized for faster processing times and high-quality outputs.
